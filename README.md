**NPAP** is an open-source Python library for **partitioning and aggregating network graphs**, with a special focus on electrical power systems. Built
on top of [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/), it provides a clean strategy-based architecture that makes it easy to cluster networks and reduce their
complexity while preserving essential properties.

Whether you're working with power grids, transportation networks, or any graph-based spatial data, NPAP helps you simplify complex networks into
manageable pieces.

## Features

- **Multiple Partitioning Algorithms** - K-means, K-medoids, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering
- **Distance Metrics** - Euclidean for local coordinates, Haversine for geographic data
- **Electrical Distance** - Partition based on PTDF-derived electrical proximity
- **Voltage-Aware Clustering** - Respects voltage levels and transformer boundaries
- **Flexible Aggregation** - Sum, average, or custom strategies for node/edge properties
- **Extensible Design** - Easy to add your own partitioning or aggregation strategies

## Installation

```bash
pip install npap
```

## Quick Start

```python
from npap import PartitionAggregatorManager, AggregationProfile, AggregationMode

# 1. Initialize the manager
manager = PartitionAggregatorManager()

# 2. Load data (voltage-aware loader for power systems)
manager.load_data(
    strategy='va_loader',
    node_file="buses.csv",
    line_file="lines.csv",
    transformer_file="transformers.csv",
    link_file="links.csv"
)

# 3. Aggregate parallel edges (optional)
manager.aggregate_parallel_edges(
    edge_properties={"x": "equivalent_reactance", "type": "first"},
    default_strategy="average"
)

# 4. Partition the network
manager.partition(strategy="electrical_kmedoids", n_clusters=50)

# 5. Visualize the partitioned network
manager.plot_network(style='clustered', title='Partitioned Network')

# 6. Aggregate with a custom profile
profile = AggregationProfile(
    mode=AggregationMode.GEOGRAPHICAL,
    topology_strategy="simple",
    node_properties={"lat": "average", "lon": "average", "voltage": "average"},
    edge_properties={"p_max": "sum", "x": "equivalent_reactance"},
    default_node_strategy="average",
    default_edge_strategy="average"
)
aggregated_network = manager.aggregate(profile=profile)

# 7. Visualize the reduced network
manager.plot_network(style='simple', title='Aggregated Network')
```
