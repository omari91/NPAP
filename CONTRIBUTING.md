## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IEE-TUGraz/npap.git
cd npap
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode with all extras
pip install -e ".[dev,test,docs]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use **Ruff** for linting and formatting. Pre-commit hooks run automatically, but you can also check manually:

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `ruff check .` | Check for linting issues |
| `ruff check --fix .` | Auto-fix linting issues |
| `ruff format .` | Format code |

### Running Tests

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `pytest` | Run all tests |
| `pytest --cov=npap` | Run with coverage report |
| `pytest test/test_partitioning.py` | Run specific test file |
| `pytest -k "test_kmeans"` | Run tests matching pattern |

### Building Documentation

```bash
cd docs
sphinx-build -b html . _build/html
# Open _build/html/index.html in your browser
```

---

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you changed any public APIs
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure all tests pass** and pre-commit hooks are happy
4. **Write a clear PR description** explaining your changes

### Commit Messages

We follow a simple, descriptive commit style:

```
Short summary of change (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Explain the "why"
rather than the "what" — the code shows what changed.
```

---

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

| Information | How to Get It |
|:------------|:--------------|
| Python version | `python --version` |
| NPAP version | `python -c "import npap; print(npap.__version__)"` |
| Minimal example | Code that reproduces the issue |
| Error traceback | Full error message |

## Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! When suggesting a feature:

- Explain the **problem** you're trying to solve
- Describe your **proposed solution**
- Consider if it fits NPAP's scope (network partitioning & aggregation)

## Code of Conduct

Be **kind and respectful**. We're all here to learn and build something useful together. Harassment or exclusionary behavior is not tolerated.
